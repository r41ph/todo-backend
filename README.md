## TODO APP BACKEND

### `npm install`

Install all the dependencies

### `npm run server`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to open in the browser.

The application establish a connection with a MongoDB database stored in the MongoDB Cloud - Atlas and it works together with the [TODO APP FRONTEND](https://github.com/r41ph/todo-frontend).

### `Note:`

Please, note that for lack of time I haven't been able to implement:

- An .env file with the sensitive data, like the password to access the DB.
- A webpack configuration to create a production bundle.
